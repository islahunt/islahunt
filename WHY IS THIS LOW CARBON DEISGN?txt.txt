I have attempted to dither images when possible (excluding when showing my work as its important for these to be in full detail), use the default typeface Georgia with no logos and by default. By default there are no cookies, ads or third party tracking. I have also only used minimal pages to streamline my content, additionally using colours that work better for low carbon design (black/grey and blues). I think that low carbon design is important now and will continue to be important in the future as it aims to reduce the effect your website has on the environment, I was surprised with the amount of people I spoke to who had never made the correlation between that digital things can actually have varying effects on the amount of carbon used.
